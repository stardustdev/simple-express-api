# Node.js MongoDB API

A simple Node.js Express API that connects to MongoDB and retrieves user data with age filtering.

## Approach

This solution implements a RESTful API endpoint that retrieves user data from MongoDB. The implementation includes proper error handling for invalid ObjectIds and enforces an age restriction (>21) on the queries. The code follows best practices with async/await pattern and proper separation of concerns.
